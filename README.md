# Mocha Doom
Mocha Doom is a pure Java Doom source port. Most of the hard work of porting Doom to Java has already been done, thanks to Velktron (Maes), but some work remains to do. Most importantly, the network code is missing. The main objective will be to write it and make it work. Secondly, there is going to be some bug fixes and some features will be added. At last, a OpenGL renderer may be added.
