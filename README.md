# Mocha Doom
Mocha Doom is a pure Java Doom source port. Most of the hard work of porting Doom to Java has already been done, thanks to Velktron (Maes), but some work remains to do. Most importantly, the network code is missing. Now that Mocha Doom's development has apparently stopped for three years, I've decided to maintain it. The main objective will be to write the network code and make the multiplayer work. Secondly, there is going to be some bug fixes and some features will be added. At last, an OpenGL renderer may be added.
